## Hello
This project is my game prototype which doesn't have a decent name. Me and my teammates just call it "Lift".

It meant to be a pilot project where we learn to make games that we like.

In short,"Lift" is a rogulike survival-horror which allow player as engeneer, go down to BlackMesa-type facility which has generated levels separated on parts to loot, 
interact with facility's systems and go to next level.

## Current State

Recently we decided to keep project alive a little longer to decide later on should it be continued or not.

*Now we need:*

- **New Inventory** system based on grids (Diablo2,EFT) and useable equipment.

- A bit different **Level Generation**(spawn multiple connected rootRooms, fill them with rooms with unique ID's and spawn actual loot)

- And refactor and rework all aspects of the game that were written at earlier stages for quick prototyping.

Right now I'm working on new inventory system. Next in the line is new Level Generation System.

Next time I will try to fill this readme with something interesting.
